BINA â€“ Business Intelligence & Analytics (FS21)

## Description

Intelligent companies need business intelligence (BI). They need it to identify, analyze, model, structure and optimize business processes. They also need it to make sense of vast amounts of unstructured data, and to support and improve meaningful - if not critical - business decisions.

The term "intelligent enterprise" refers not only to commercial enterprises but also to (hopefully) intelligent administrations, intelligently managed educational institutions, efficient hospitals, and so on. Any complex business activity can benefit from BI.

Machine learning, including data analytics, is part of the BI domain. However, before a "machine" can learn from data, data must be collected and stored and presented in a unified form. This so-called data provisioning requires, for example, extracting data from relevant business processes and possibly also from Web sources such as social networks, cleansing it, transforming it, integrating it and loading it into a data warehouse or other database. To enable people to interact efficiently with the various manifestations and phases of these activities, data visualization methods and tools are necessary. 

BI goes beyond just data and aims to identify, model and optimize a company's business processes. 

In the context of a case study, the theories around BI were applied on the basis of a real project.
